### Security Best Practices

When using esphome-client:

#### Secure API Keys
- **Never commit API keys to version control**
- Use environment variables or secure configuration files
- Rotate keys regularly
- Use unique keys per device when possible

#### Network Security
- Use encrypted connections (Noise protocol) when available
- Validate server certificates in production
- Consider using VPNs or network isolation for IoT devices
- Monitor network traffic for unusual patterns

#### Input Validation
- Validate all data received from ESPHome devices
- Sanitize data before logging or displaying
- Be cautious with device names and other user-controllable fields

#### Dependency Management
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities
- Use `cargo audit` to check for known vulnerabilities

### Vulnerability Categories

We are particularly interested in vulnerabilities related to:

- **Authentication bypass**: Issues with API key validation
- **Code injection**: Malicious data from devices causing code execution
- **Denial of service**: Issues that could crash or hang the client
- **Information disclosure**: Unintended exposure of sensitive data
- **Cryptographic issues**: Problems with the Noise protocol implementation
- **Dependency vulnerabilities**: Issues in third-party crates

### Security Features

esphome-client includes several security features:

- **Memory safety**: Written in Rust, preventing many common vulnerabilities
- **No unsafe code**: The codebase forbids unsafe code blocks
- **Input validation**: Protocol messages are validated using protobuf
- **Encrypted communication**: Support for Noise protocol encryption
- **Dependency auditing**: Regular security audits of dependencies

### Scope

This security policy covers:

- The esphome-client library code
- Build scripts and configuration
- Documentation that could affect security
- Dependencies when they affect esphome-client security

This policy does not cover:

- ESPHome firmware vulnerabilities (report to ESPHome project)
- Network infrastructure vulnerabilities
- Operating system or hardware vulnerabilities
- Vulnerabilities in applications using esphome-client (unless caused by the library)

Thank you for helping keep esphome-client and its users safe! ðŸ”’
